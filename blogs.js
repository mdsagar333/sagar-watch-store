He first started making silverware and decorative items, moving on to make jewellery in 1905. The quality of work and the innovation of design prompted people to fall in love with the style and pizzazz, making Bvlgari a name to content with.",

      "The Breitling Chronomat holds a special place in the hearts of watch enthusiasts all over the world. The watch is a symbol of mechanical superiority and horological prowess. It was originally released in 1984, an era when extra-thin quartz timepieces were the hottest things in the market. Breitling, however, had different ideas. The Swiss watchmaker made the boldest of moves by releasing a mechanical watch that was nothing short of impressive. The watch, Chronomat, proved to be a winner and eventually became something that people associate with that era.

The watch can hold its own at red carpets, at official board meetings, and at the occasional home parties. In 1984, the Chronomat marked a glorious return of Breitling as a master of mechanical chronographs, something that the Swiss watchmaker based its entire reputation on.",
